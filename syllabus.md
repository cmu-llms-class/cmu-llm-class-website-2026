## Important Details

* **Location**: DH A302
* **Time**: Tuesdays and Thursdays 11 AM - 12:20 PM
* **Instructor email**: llms-11-766@andrew.cmu.edu

## Course Description

Large language models are used today for many more applications than just modelling language. In this course, we learn how Transformer-based neural language models have been adapted for applications ranging from web agents and retrieval systems to music generation and coding and writing assistants. We will systematically examine the ways different applications adapt the base technologies underlying large language models. For each application, we will aim to answer the following questions:

- Can the application be developed with a general-purpose frontier language model, or is application-specific training beneficial or necessary?
- If training: what do the data, model architecture, and training procedure look like?
- What is the computational infrastructure (for example, inference algorithms, output filtering, user interfaces) one needs to build around the LLM to support the application?
- What does evaluation of the LLM's usefulness look like for this application?
- What are the limitations and open challenges for applying LLMs to the application?

## Learning Goals

Students who successfully complete this course will be able to:

* Determine the best LLM tools for the diversity of different applications
* Understand how these tools are implemented and feel confident in making modifications to these implementations
* Read and comprehend recent, academic papers on customizing LLMs for different applications
* Design a novel LLM system for an application of their choice

## Prerequisites

This class is intended for students who have already learned the basics of how language models are implemented and are curious to develop an understanding of the advanced techniques used for customizing them to different applications.
We expect students to have already taken 11-667, 11-711, 10-423, or another class that teaches language model fundamentals.
If you have questions about whether you meet this prerequisite, please reach out to the course instructors at llms-11-766@andrew.cmu.edu.

## Class Format

Classes will be in person, every Tuesday and Thursday 11:00AM-12:20PM in DH A302.

**Readings**: There will be reading materials for each lecture, which students are required to read through  _before_ the class.

**Interactive Activities**:
There will be interactive activities interspersed through the lectures.
These will include discussions of the course context and short quizzes.

## Assessment

**Homeworks**:
There will be three homework assignments, to be completed individually.
The homeworks will comprise a mixture of written and coding questions.

**Final Project**:
Students will complete a final project that focuses on exploring in depth a specific application of their choice.

**Scribe Notes**:
Each student will be assigned one lecture to act as scribe and prepare notes to share with the rest of the class one week after the lecture.  Notes should be written in a prose style and will be evaluated for completeness, including content and references. In the event that there are more students than lectures, students will be assigned to scribe in pairs.

**In Class Participation**:
We will use Poll Everywhere to run in-class polls and quizzes. Participate in at least 80% of these for full participation marks.

**Grading:**
Your grade will be computed as:

* 30%: Homeworks
    * Each homework is worth 10% of your grade.
* 40%: Project
* 10%: Scribe notes
* 20%: In-class participation

## Late Policy

For each unexcused day your homework is late, we will subtract 5% from your final grade for the homework.
For example, if you submit your homework 1 minute late, and your grade would otherwise be a 97%, it will drop down to 92%. If you submit 26 hours late, and your grade would otherwise be 90%, it will drop down to 80%.

You may ask for an excused late day or days any time **before** the deadline. 
If your excuse is approved, your grade will not be penalized.
Valid excuses are medical and personal health issues and other extenuating life circumstances.
Requests for excused late days may be emailed to llms-11-766@andrew.cmu.edu.

In the event of a medical emergency, please make your personal health, physical and mental, your first priority. Seek help from medical and care providers such as University Health Services. Students can request medical extensions after the deadline with proof/note from providers. 

## Accommodations
If you have a disability and require
accommodations, please contact Catherine Getchell, Director of Disability Resources, 412-268-6121,
getchell@cmu.edu.
If you have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office, we encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs with us as early in the semester as possible.
We will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate.

## Policy on Missing Class

If you must miss class, you can consult the scribe notes from the class.
We do plan to make classes interactive, so please try to attend.

## Academic Integrity
Please take some time to read through CMU's [Academic Integrity Policy](https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html).
Students who violate this policy will be subject to the disciplinary actions described in the [Student Handbook](https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic/index.html).

### Collaboration on Homeworks
The six homeworks should be completed individually.
However, we encourage you to ask questions on Piazza and in office hours.
While you may discuss strategies amongst yourselves, all experiments and analyses should be your own.

### Use of Language Models
Using a language model to generate any part of a homework answer, scribe notes, and project report will be considered a violation of academic integrity.
To reiterate, all written words in your homework and project reports should be written by yourself, without the use of AI (unless you are quoting AI outputs as part of your answer).

You may however use AI to learn more about the subject material of the class, help organize your thoughts, or to help you write code.
If you do use AI systems to help with the homework, please fill out the "Use of AI" question on the homework to help the instructors understand your usage.
Use of AI without making an honest attempt at answering this question will be considered a violation of academic integrity.
